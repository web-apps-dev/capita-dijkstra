# Dijkstra Routing Exercise

## Development Notes

The idea is for the Graph component to send the `start` (left click) and `destination` (right click) nodes to the Selection and Results components. The Results component will then call the dijkstra library function to perform the calculation.

**See the `dev` branch for more complete functionality.**

## Caveats

- No media queries.
